# EX 3C Sudoku Solver
## DATE: 25-03-2025
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the solution of sudoku puzzle using Backtracking.

## Algorithm
1. Scan the board to find an empty cell (value 0).
2. For that cell (i, j), try placing values from 1 to 9.
3. For each value:
   - Check validity using isPossible():
   - Not present in the same row.
   - Not present in the same column.
   - Not present in the corresponding 3Ã—3 subgrid.

4. If valid:
   - Place the value in the cell.
   - Recursively call solve() to fill the rest.
   - If dead-end reached, backtrack by resetting the cell to 0.
5. If all cells are filled (no 0 found), print the board (solution found).
6. This explores all possible valid board configurations recursively.
